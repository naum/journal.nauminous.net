Essays on politics, computers, technology, radio, Arizona, science, justice, war, world affairs, globalization, economics, games, design, sports, history, comics, psychology, philosophy, religion and any other interesting tidbits I stumble about on the internets or bits that leak out from the deep recesses of my thought laden mind.

I am Naum, amateur writer and rabble rouser, professional programmer and website developer. I have a degree in Computer Science, and that renders me totally unqualified to lecture on any subject other than programming computing machines or the sublime sport of baseball.
